This directory is a course I work as a grader.

According to the syllybus, the course materials cover basic HTML/CSS and JavaScript. The course also goes through Node.js, NPM, API, database as well as framework like React.js.

The grade workload is around 110 students' submissions per week, which takes about 10-20 hours to grade. With the help with Github Classroom and my auto-grade.py, I don't need to open .html files hundreds of times repeatly. I also spend some time in giving feedback to students on Canvas.
